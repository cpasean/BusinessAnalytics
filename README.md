# Ford GoBike System
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. I'm most interested in figuring out what features are best for predicting the business revenue and asset(bike) depreciation by referring to the duration time and distance. In addition, I am also interested in finding marketing points that are likely to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the business. I expect the type of users will have the most potent effect on duration and distance because subscribers are more likely to use the bike than customers along long stretches. I also think this will be variable depending on the day of the week.
